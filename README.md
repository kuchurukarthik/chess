Heuristic Search Algorithms to play Chess.

As part of CS5400 course I've implemented four different algorithms to play Chess.

1. Random Search (Selects a move randomly from a list of all available valid moves)
2. Iterative-Deepening Depth-Limited MiniMax
3. Time-Limited Iterative-Deepening Depth-Limited MiniMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
4. Time-Limited Iterative-Deepening Depth-Limited MiniMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning with Quiescent Search
